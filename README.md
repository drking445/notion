Notion Javascript Client- this scripts reads in data from a csv file, calculates the average book ratings and the number of favorites for each book, and then displays the book data

First run:

    npm install
    
Second run:
   
    node index.js
    
- Was there anything you got stuck on, and if so what did you do to resolve it?

I was stuck on how to insert into the table and I figured it out by printing out the data to find the ids of the columns. I was also stuck on reading the data into memory from the csv and I resolved this by manually reading in the data.


- Do you have any suggestions for improving the API documentation to make it clearer or easier to use?

No, I think it was fairly straightforward
